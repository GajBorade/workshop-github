# workshop-github
this is a workshop for creating repos and cloning them
This is just for testing - message
We did a push but had to do a  git pull origin main --rebase first as there this error : 
! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:GajBorade/workshop-github.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not
hint: have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing to
hint: the same ref. If you want to integrate the remote changes, use
hint: 'git pull' before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
